- Refactor package names bibimbap => io.bibimbap

- Implement consolidate.

- Strings:
  - proper implementation of LaTeX -> Java translation/parsing
  - decide what `new` and `edit` actually edit (currently Java, maybe LaTeX, maybe both)

- PDFs:
  - extract references from them (there is an old `pdf` branch with some code to get started)
  - import into Lucene for full-text search
  - go fetch them on the web
  - infuriate publishers

- Bibsonomy integration? Not too exciting at this point. Perhaps actual users should step in.

- World domination.
